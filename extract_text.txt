sometimes it's not necessary for you to know how it's going to happen but it's very necessary for you to believe that it's going to happen if you believe that it's going to happen is when the how takes care of itself [Applause] okay first of all I must thank you so much for agreeing to do this we've have absolutely enraptured audience we're all looking forward to this they want to decode this Enigma called Wiki kosher it seems like a mysterious uh and and yet such such a draw that you have over especially the youngsters it's something absolutely breathtaking so the uh the theme of the event is the stories we tell also tell us so we want to know your story was it an unlikely one I mean could you take us back to the few days of engineering and then how have you journeyed how it all started off because I know that it you know we're also with an industrial event if I'm not wrong a lightning struck I would actually like to take the story a little further back oh lovely for two years of my life I have stood at the bus stop right here I was a midi by student oh wow okay so two years of my life I have stood at this bus stop I was a science student so my classes used to be from 7 7 30 to one o'clock in the afternoon and I used to stand at the bus stop over here wait for 79 33 38 these were the three buses that used to take me home and I want to know how much does the water power cost over here now it's pretty steep now it's pretty steep 30. 20. so when I was when I was doing my junior college in vitibai this was 2001 to 2003. by the way when was the last time you had a what about what about I keep having what up I won't say it yeah yeah I called for buttercups but uh in 2001 to 2003 I was in mitibai and that time the varapa used to be of five rupees five rupees so uh I've started from here right and uh then of course I did my engineering from Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology till that time I'm still that guy but I've always believed in living in the present going with the flow and just being completely honest to what I'm doing now the plan was to do post graduation I was good in studies but I was very active on stage since childhood but never really thought that I want to make it a career choice right so when I was doing my engineering in the second year the college faculty took us to an industrial visit to show us this is your future you know when you pass out you complete your graduation this is how an MNC looks this is how the work all right whatever the floor looks and how people work so that was the first time I started introspecting as to what do you want to do so the answer was performing performing for the audience the rule was in the family that first you have to finish graduation you have to finish it well I had a blast doing my engineering I finished that and then in 2009 is when I started my journey as an actor okay yeah okay so that's that's how it all began uh as audience we always like to look at the Glory Days of an actor of of how he's doing well and all the success and Fanfare that he's enjoying but failures is something that we don't talk about like everyone has a good share of it uh was it a very was it a straight Story Journey because I because if I'm not wrong you started off with assisting on a rug and then your first break uh so was it a straightforward Journey how did you take failures it was a straightforward Journey but of course I wanted to learn acting of course I wanted to learn the skills but more than that I just wanted to be sure that if I made to act every day am I a happier Soul or am I a cribbing about it that's what I really wanted to know so I did that and by the end of it I got my answer that I really really love doing this after that I was also sure I remember I was 22. back then right after engineering I was 22. I was in no hurry to be in front of the camera right because I knew that firstly camera captures everything you're a good actor bad actor fantastic actor worst actor it will present you the way you are because in acting your eyes have to be honest and the cap the camera captures everything the audience in two seconds of sitting in that Cinema Hall in that first shot you're given that first scene that you do they know that if you can act or no and once they've made that judgment it's a very uphill task to really prove your words to the audience so I wanted to do all of that before actually coming to the audience you're very patient so I I had kept I had kept five years in my mind to learn the tropes to make people learn from them assist them do backstage in theater do everything that is related to cinema and acting learn all that I can before I'm fairly even confident to face the camera and come in front of the audience so it's very strange because when I was doing that acting course in 2009 I still remember the date was 24th of July 2009 and it was the first day of my acting course and the teacher it was it was class of 20 20 students and they just randomly asked like you know okay how have your five last five years been like and we were all discussing that and then they asked that do you want your next five years to be like and where do you see yourself in the next five years and I really am not a big fan of this question because I don't know what I'm going to do in the next five minutes and I really don't want to know what I'm going to where I'm going to be sometimes where you think you're going to be in the next five years is much smaller than what God has black for you so I don't want to limit myself in the in that thought process but still so but I was asked that I'll do theater I'll assist somebody I'll do behind the scene work and I'll I'll be there this was 24 July 2009 and 24th July 2015 was the day when masan released and my poster was there on a cinema it's exactly five years and it's just sometimes things like these make me uh belief in belief like believe in belief that you know okay you just have to sometimes just just give it out there just give it out and do it like you know sometimes it's not necessary for you to know how it's gonna happen but it's very necessary for you to believe that it's going to happen if you believe that it's going to happen is when the how takes care of itself so I mean you guys are going to start and do whatever you want to do in life but never never lose that belief that's that's step one before skill before Talent before everything else that's step one great that's that and I also want to give a disclaimer that I tend to forget my questions and I go on a different trip so just get me back whenever you want to do with the failure part failure yes yes I saw it was very important because when you look at the youngsters of course they are very bad at accepting rejection and and failure is something that rattles them yeah so I think it's equally important how you receive failure because that's going to happen at some point of time so what was how did you receive failure because there are a lot of people who look up to you and I feel failures must rattle you I feel they must rattle you they must shake you up because it's only something good that comes out of it failure I feel is is also one of the beginning stages for Success right uh people say that persistence and perseverance are the two tricks for success but I feel failure has also got to do a big part in that right what kind of acting do you think that there is something called as a classical acting style there's method acting or do you think it's just these distinctions don't really I don't really believe in one one approach towards acting because I feel at the end of the day between action and cut I have to be honest my goal is to reach that Honesty no matter how I reach that different films different characters depending on how far or near that character is to you you you decide on your route for me it's my world it's that character's world so I need to know my world in the film so between takes sometimes it's just knowing sometimes for me as an actor it's more of knowing um the space most of the times it's bonding with your co-actors because depends again on how your relationship in the film is like me and tapsi from an emergency we would like we were practically living together like it was almost like we were on set together the entire time because that that had to come across in the film or be it me and Ranbir and Sanju we would our workshop for the film was for like 30 to 40 days before we started shooting it was just me Ranbir and Raju sir sitting at his office for hours at stage and faffing that's it faffing just faffing but it was just faffing because the energy that we have while we fast that is the energy that we wanted in the film between those two characters it is what the audience always remembers what's between those lines in real life it's not what we speak that matters it's what we not speak what we hold back is makes me makes you you who you are so I need to know what I said as that part and what are the things that I didn't say as the part but which was there in my head so you need to bond with your co-actors need to know them gel with them so all of that is going on with your team because at the end of the day it's a team effort you know the set has to be a happy set it has to be a nice and people should enjoy working together the important thing is to just keep walking just keep walking just keep working just keep working yeah correct please wonderful thank you thank you
